Situation - One operation can be viewed as steps of multiple smaller operations 
  Step1
   step2
   step3

Then if id o normally my class would keep on increasing / interface would keep on expanding


So instead i make class depend on a class handler which internally has next Handler. So my client only needs Handler,
which is not eexpanding now.

Cleint -> Handler -> Handler -> Handler

Diff with decorator
In decoratr operation IS done on object, Here REQUEST is being passed to do an operation for request. Not 
doing operation ON the objects. Purpose is to fulfil request, not DO AN OPERATION on the object.
