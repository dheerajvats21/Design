So if there is a situation that you have a templte that can be filled with a resource as far as resource gives you
items to be put in template. 
So if there are m templates and n resource. 
Option 1 - You make firstTemplateFirstResourceClass, firstTemplateSecondResourceClass,
    secondTemplateFirstResourceClass and so on to make m x n classes.
Option 2 - you see the they can be decoupled, in every class you writing logic to get the thing or item to be 
put into template , So you can parameterise it in template. You get a Resource object and call itemA(), itemB()... 
and so on on that to fill the template. Then it can be any resource (first, second any).

Example - There maybe different forms or page templates (in websites making sites). As far as you give them
header(), footer(), dp() etc. theyt can fill the template. So you dont need to make Form1Book class and Form1Artist
class. You can make Resources out of Book and Artist and pass those resources objects to Form class,
it can use them to fill its details to return view(). 

So 

    IForm -------> IResource  
     |              |
     |              |
     v              v
  ConcreteForms    ConcreteResources ---> Resource(Book, artist)
   (LongForm,
   shortform)
